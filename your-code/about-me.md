NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

Sebas discovered by "accident" the world of data analytics, overall he is not sure if he likes this or not; it's more like enjoying the trip rather than the destination, however what he likes is the challenges that his profesor makes, probably he was too much time without actually using his brain, and now he needs to re-develop that logic/memory skill that he didn't used long time ago. He will make it through? Or, he will succumb to his inner demon the sloth? Let's find out.
